Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'

type() 
you can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

Mutiple variables
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Concat
a="python"
b="is"
c="awesome"
print(a,b,c)
   OR
a="python"
b="is"
c="awesome"
print(a+" "+b+ " " +c)

with mutiple data types a;ways use commas ont use + for concatenation
#error
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
Use: print(x,y)


Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.

a=5
def myfunction():
  a=4
  print(a+5)
print(a+5)
myfunction()

op-10
9


x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

op-python is fantastic
